* About
  Inspired by other init.el files written in org-mode and burdened by
  my existing configuration, I've decided to write mine as an org-file
  too.
* How it works
  init.el loads this file using org-babel by
  ~(require 'org)~
  ~(org-babel-load-file~
  ~(expand-file-name "init.org"~
                     ~user-emacs-directory))~
                     bootstrap.el installs all packages I use
* Installation
  To install, clone the git hub repository
  https://github.com/widp/.emacs.d/
  to ~/.emacs.d/
* TODO Theme
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (load-theme 'solarized)
  #+END_SRC
* TODO Projectile

* TODO Look at existing packages that you use and port them
  Candidates
    - Org interleave
    - pdf tools keybindings
    - not much email
    - theme switcher
    - sclang emacs package
* TODO Org mode, org-journal etc
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-agenda-files
       (directory-files-recursively "~/Documents/org_files/"))
  #+END_SRC
